  Frontend-specific checks for React applications: component design,
  state management, accessibility, bundle size, and API contracts.

constraints:
  language:
    primary: typescript
    notes:
      - Prefer TypeScript for all new components.
  dependencies:
    policy: minimize
    rules:
      - Any new dependency must be justified and evaluated for bundle impact.
      - Prefer tree-shakeable packages.
  architecture:
    rules:
      - Components should be small and composable.
      - Separate presentation from logic (hooks, containers).
      - Avoid prop drilling; use context or state management where appropriate.

checklists:
  - id: COMPONENT_DESIGN
    title: Component design
    checks:
      - "Are new components specified with props, state, and behavior?"
      - "Is component hierarchy and data flow documented?"
      - "Are reusable vs page-specific components distinguished?"

  - id: STATE_MANAGEMENT
    title: State management
    checks:
      - "Is the state management approach specified (local, context, store)?"
      - "Are side effects and async operations handled explicitly?"
      - "Is state shape defined for shared state?"

  - id: ACCESSIBILITY
    title: Accessibility
    checks:
      - "Are ARIA roles and labels specified for interactive elements?"
      - "Is keyboard navigation addressed?"
      - "Are color contrast and screen reader concerns mentioned?"

  - id: API_INTEGRATION
    title: API integration
    checks:
      - "Are API request/response types defined?"
      - "Is error handling for API calls specified?"
      - "Are loading and empty states addressed?"

  - id: TESTING_FE
    title: Frontend testing
    checks:
      - "Are component tests planned (unit + integration)?"
      - "Is user interaction testing specified (click, type, navigate)?"
      - "Are accessibility tests included?"

  - id: PERFORMANCE
    title: Performance
    checks:
      - "Is bundle size impact considered for new dependencies?"
      - "Are code splitting and lazy loading addressed where relevant?"
      - "Are re-render optimizations considered for list/table views?"

heuristics:
  contradictions:
    - trigger_a: "no new dependencies"
      trigger_b: "install"
      severity: CRITICAL
      note: "Plan claims no new deps but installs packages."
  ambiguity_triggers:
    - "fast"
    - "responsive"
    - "smooth"
    - "modern"
    - "clean UI"
    - "optimize later"
    - "best practices"
